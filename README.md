### What's that?
that's the fruit of **weekend boredom**. it's actually an industrial pedal, connected to arduino leonardo as a momentory switch. the code will sample the duration of each `tap` and then mapped to keyboard strokes.

### Tap Durations 
the following is a map of pedal-tap durations and their keyboard stokes 
- `50 ms` = <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> 
- `500 ms` = <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>
- `1000 ms` = `hard-coded` password *(yeah yeah, not secured. but it's worth it)*

### Components

- [Arduino Leonardo](http://www.ebay.com/itm/201037850851) (keyboard simulation does not supported out of the box on `uno` model)
